#  Dashboards Included

1️⃣ **Indian Historical Crop Production & Nutrient Dashboard**
2️⃣ **Indian Historical Crop Environment Impact Dashboard**

---

# 📖 Project Overview

Agriculture in India is highly influenced by:

* Cultivation area
* Crop type
* Nutrient usage (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
* Rainfall
* Temperature
* Soil conditions
* Humidity & wind patterns

This project analyzes historical agricultural data from 1966–2017 using Tableau to understand:

* Production trends
* Nutrient dependency
* Environmental impact on yield
* Crop-wise performance

Both dashboards are interactive with filters for **Year, State, and District**.

---

# 🎯 Business Problem

Indian agriculture faces key challenges:

* Increasing fertilizer usage
* Climate variability
* Yield inefficiency
* Uneven regional productivity
* Rising environmental dependency

Stakeholders need answers to:

1. Which crops dominate total production?
2. How has cultivated area changed over time?
3. Is increased nutrient usage improving yield?
4. How does rainfall and temperature affect crop yield?
5. What environmental factors most influence productivity?

This project provides data-driven insights to support sustainable agricultural planning.
